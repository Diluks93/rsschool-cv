## Personal information

I am 28 years old. I have wife and I have child. I`m working construction-engineer, but I want change my work.
My goal is **Full-stuck developer**.
I want to navigate from all sides of the application release.

My strengths: 
* *perseverance,* 
* *I understand as much as possible what I am doing,* 
* *learnability,* 
* *dedication,* 
* *enthusiasm.*

I haven’t worked in IT, but I’ve been going to turn my life around for a long time. I am well versed in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, AutoCAD, Adobe Reader and other similar applications.

**I always love to learn new things. I love to study.**

## Ability

I'm not bad at **HTML5**, **CSS3**. I'm using the **SASS** preprocessor. I use semantic tags, flex-box, grids, 
animations css. I can customize the adaptation.

Good at **BOOTSTRAP5**.

I speak **JavaScript** at the level of *ModalWindow, Slider, Tabs* and similar scripts. With the help of **Jquery**, I can customize the validation and mask of forms, as well as use various frameworks (*parallax, swipper, etc.*).

I study **PHP** and **MySQL** (so far only the basics), with the help of mailer I can set up sending letters to mail. 

I study the **BEM** methodology and try to apply it - it's convenient. 

I use **PixelPerfect** and the **W3C** validator. 

I think I know **GIT** 2/5 and am eager to learn it (very useful). *I don't know any other version control systems*.

I am using **Gulp**. Not my own development, but downloaded and sorted out [gulp-scss-starter-master](https://github.com/andreyalexeich/gulp-scss-starter). I always try to minimize code (*SVG sprites, fonts, image re-encoding without loss of quality*). I work with **Figma**,**Photoshop**. 


## Code examples
```function rgb(r, g, b){
function toHex(el) {
return el <= 0 ? '00' : el >= 255 ? 'FF' : ('0' + (Number(el).toString(16))).slice(-2).toUpperCase();
}  
return toHex(r) + toHex(g) + toHex(b);
}
```
